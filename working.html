            <div class="history">
                <h3 class="subtitle">A Bit of History</h3>
                <p>I feel that my background in design is very similar to many people in the industry—I started with a love for art from a young age; I can remember my mother coming home with our first Apple Computer; I spent as much time learning on the computer as I did playing video games; and eventually created logos and t-shirts for my friends’ bands and side projects.</p>
                <p>At UC Santa Barbara, I studied Art and Economics but most of my education came from work projects. In the summer after freshman year, I was introduced to the team at Oniracom and worked with them as the designer on projects for Jack Johnson, G Love, Matt Costa and a few others from Brushfire Records. It was absolutely incredible to be around such a talented group of individuals who all loved what they were working on and it was at this job where I learned where I wanted to direct my design career.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of college, I started an organic-clothing company in Santa Barbara and I was working for a couple of companies around Los Angeles and San Francisco. For a couple of years, I enjoyed working with larger companies like Adobe and AARP, but I always felt like such a small piece in the overall project that I was left wanting more.</p>
                <p>It was during a vacation to Colorado where I met with Room 214 and decided to move to Boulder, CO to join up as their design director. It was a fantastic opportunity where I was working with great clients like Travel Channel and Horizon Organic, and I was actually leading design efforts. The time spent with the agency was also important in learning more about client services, business opportunities and running a shop.</p>
                <p>After a few years with Room 214, I left to join the Mocavo team and go through Techstars in Boulder. As one of the 3 founding members, I was again in charge of the company’s design, but I was also able to learn quite a bit about growing a business and focusing on a single product for a few years. It was an invaluable experience to watch as the team grew from just a few people to a large team spread across three states with a product used by millions of people around the world.</p>
                <p>My most recent change occured in August 2013 when I left Mocavo to start my own design studio. I missed working on new design projects and also missed seeing a variety of clients after looking at a single digital product for a few years. Since then, I’ve taken my previous experiences of working with companies large and small to build out a company that can grow with me. The focus for The Studio of Andy Stone right now is to build lasting digital products that are as beautiful as they are useful.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I’m building an app for restaurant owners called Bistro with two of my closest friends and exploring the beautiful Colorado outdoors with my wife.</p>
