				<p class="callout">Hello, I'm a freelance designer living in Boulder, CO. I spend my time working on branding and interactive projects with a few select companies. I love good design and bad movies.</p>

				<p>For the last eight years, I've been creating interactive products for startups and national brands. More recently, I've focused my efforts on digital product design for a few select clients here in Colorado. On the side, I am building an app for restaurants called <a href="#">Bistro</a> and an event-based iPhone app yet to be named. If you'd like to talk about your next design project, <a href="#">get in touch</a>.</p>

I’ve been practicing and learning design, in one form or another, for nearly eleven years now. It is shocking just to think…<span class="readmore"><a href="#">Read More</a></span></p>
