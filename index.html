					<p>Over the last nine years, I've worked in print and digital design for startups and national brands. After five years of working in the agency world, my more recent work has been focused on digital-product design and development. In my free time, I’m building an app for restaurant owners called <a href="http://bistro.is/" target="_blank">Bistro</a> and a reading app for the iPhone that is still in the works.
