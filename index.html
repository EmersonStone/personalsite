				<p class="callout">Hello, I'm a designer living in Boulder, CO. Currently, I spend my time working on branding and interactive projects with a few select companies. I love good typography and bad movies.</p>

If you'd like to chat about your next design project, <a href="#">get in touch</a>.</p>

From a very young age, I learned to love books by seeing the care and affinity that my father had for them.

I’ve been practicing and learning design, in one form or another, for nearly eleven years now. It is shocking just…<span class="readmore"><a href="#">Read More</a></span></p>
