				<p class="callout">Hello, I'm a designer living in Boulder, CO. I spend my time working on branding and interactive projects with a few select companies. I love good typography and bad movies.</p>

				<p>For the last eight years, I've been creating interactive products for startups and national brands. More recently, I've focused my efforts on digital product design for a few select clients here in Colorado. On the side, I am building an app for restaurants called <a href="#">Bistro</a> and an event-based iPhone app yet to be named. If you'd like to talk about your next design project, <a href="#">get in touch</a>.</p>

From a very young age, I learned to love books by seeing the care and affinity that my father had for them. While the design community has amazing resources and websites for learning how to start out on your own, I still believe in the need for great books in a design education. I’ve been practicing and learning design, in one form or another, for nearly eleven years now. It is shocking just to think…<span class="readmore"><a href="#">Read More</a></span></p>
