				<h3 class="subtitle" data-highlight="No. 1">An Introduction</h3>
				<p class="callout">Hello, I'm a designer living in Boulder, CO. Currently, I spend my time working on branding and interactive projects with a few select companies. I love good typography and bad movies.</p>

If you'd like to chat about your next design project, <a href="#">get in touch</a>.</p>

I’ve been practicing and learning design, in one form or another, for nearly eleven years now. It is shocking just…<span class="readmore"><a href="#">Read More</a></span></p>
