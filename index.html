After five years of working in the agency world, the last few years has revolved around more digital-product design and development. In my free time, I’m building an app for restaurant owners called <a href="http://bistro.is/" target="_blank">Bistro</a> and a reading app for the iPhone that is still in the works.

From a very young age, I learned to love books by seeing the care and affinity that my father had for them.
